**Releases**
The release process has been updated starting at the 0.5 release. To create a new release, follow the following steps:
 1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench/releases) in the GitHub UI and press the _Draft a new release_ button
 2. Set the upcoming tag in the _Choose a tag_ and _Release title_ (i.e. `0.6`) fields
 3. The [release.yml](https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) CI workflow should now automatically create and upload the package to PyPI. Check if this happened on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/ema-workbench/).
 4. Finally, open a new PR in which the version number in [ema_workbench/__init__.py](https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench/blob/master/ema_workbench/__init__.py) is updated towards the next release (i.e. `"2.4.0-dev"`).
